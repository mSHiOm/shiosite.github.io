#### Title: Volu-Me Fan: Turn Your Layered-fan into a Volumetric Display

#### Main Contributor: Hidetaka Katsuyama

#### Abstract
This paper proposes Volu-Me, which displays multi-layer images by projecting onto a layered-fan rotating at high speed. In this system, each propeller part of the fan is projected by a high-speed projector. The rotation of the fan is measured by a sensor, and the projected image is generated in accordance with the rotation of the propeller section, which makes the system applicable to any fan. This system enables users to observe 3D layered images without wearing special equipment, and multiple users can observe at the same time. In this paper, we implement the prototype of the system and show the results of the projections, and discuss the potential and future extension of the system.
