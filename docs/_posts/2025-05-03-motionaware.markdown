#### Title: Motion-Aware Image Interaction Using Temporal Additive Color Mixing and High-Speed Projection

#### Main Contributor: Shio Miyafuji, Arisa Kohtani

#### Abstract
This study explores a novel interaction method in Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) that enables direct interaction with images without relying on external devices. In the proposed method, a single image is decomposed into multiple frames and projected at high speed. Through temporal additive color mixing and afterimage effects, the image perceived by the user changes based on their gaze movement. This paper introduces two demonstrations based on different decomposition methods: Demo 1 uses mosaic patterns to guide user gaze by displaying highly salient images during movement while allowing the original image to appear when stationary. Demo 2 adjusts the display ratios of the target and complementary images to make the target image visible in the afterimage of a moving object. The proposed method facilitates interaction solely through user or object movement, without requiring cameras or sensors, and holds potential for applications in public advertisements and signage.
