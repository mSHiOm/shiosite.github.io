#### Title: Visual Effects Achieved through Temporal Additive Color Mixing on OLED Panels

#### Main Contributor: Masahiro Nara

#### Abstract
This study explores visual effects on high-refresh-rate LCDs using temporal additive color mixing. Stationary viewers see gray, while moving viewers perceive color breaking and colored afterimages. The method has potential for motion-responsive digital signage.
