#### Title: Enhancing Skill Acquisition in High Sensitivity Situations: A VR-Based Gaze Guidance Approach

#### Main Contributor: Hayato Yamaguchi

#### Abstract
Microsurgical suturing requires advanced skills, and gaze behavior plays a crucial role in skill acquisition. This study explores the relationship between gaze behavior and body ownership by implementing a VR-based training application with a 3D puzzle task. To encourage appropriate gaze behavior, we introduced a planar overlay shield that appears when the userâ€™s gaze deviates from the central task area. A user study evaluated the effects of gaze control during and after training. The results showed that gaze control effectively directed gaze toward the central task in training sessions. However, it did not significantly improve gaze behavior post-training. These findings suggest that while gaze guidance influences gaze direction, it may not directly facilitate gaze behavior acquisition. Future work will explore alternative gaze guidance techniques and their impact on body ownership to develop a more effective training system for
microsurgical suturing.
